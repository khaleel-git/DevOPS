# Ansible Cheat Sheet (YAML)
## Getting Started with Ansible
Ansible is a powerful automation tool that simplifies configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. This cheat sheet provides essential commands and configurations to kickstart your journey with Ansible.
## Ansible Configuration Files
**Default Configuration File**: `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`  
Ansible's default configuration file organizes settings into various sections, ensuring flexibility and customization.

## Install Ansible
```centos
# redhat/centos machine
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install python-pip
sudo pip install ansible

# upgrade ansible
sudo pip install --upgrade ansible
```

```ini
[defaults]

[inventory]

[privilege_escalation]

[paramiko_connection]

[ssh_connection]

[persistent_connection]

[colors]
```

### Overriding Configuration
Modify configuration on-the-fly with:
```bash
$ ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/opt/ansible-web.cfg ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```
### Ansible Configuration Variables
Customize playbook behavior with environment variables:
`ANSIBLE_GATHERING=explicit ansible-playbook playbook.yml`
Export variables for persistent settings:
```bash
export ANSIBLE_GATHERING=explicit
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```
## View Configuration
```bash
ansible-config list # Lists all configurations
ansible-config view # shows the current config file
ansible-config dump # Shows the current setting
```

## Default inventory file location and parameters:
```bash
Default_path: 
/etc/ansible/hosts

Parameters:
ansible_connection -ssh/winrm/localhost
ansible_port - 22/5986
ansible_user - root/user1/user2
ansible_ssh_pass - Password
```
### Example:
```
# Sample ini Inventory File

# Web Servers
web1 ansible_host=server1.company.com ansible_connection=ssh ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_pass=Password123!
web2 ansible_host=server2.company.com ansible_connection=ssh ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_pass=Password123!
web3 ansible_host=server3.company.com ansible_connection=ssh ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_pass=Password123!

# Database Servers
db1 ansible_host=server4.company.com ansible_connection=winrm ansible_user=administrator ansible_password=Password123!


[web_servers]
web1 ansible_host=server1.company.com ansible_connection=ssh ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_pass=Password123!
web2 ansible_host=server2.company.com ansible_connection=ssh ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_pass=Password123!
web3 ansible_host=server3.company.com ansible_connection=ssh ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_pass=Password123!

[db_servers]
db1 ansible_host=server4.company.com ansible_connection=winrm ansible_user=administrator ansible_password=Password123!

[all_servers:children]
web_servers
db_servers
```

## Ansible Variables
```
ansible_connection
ansible_port
ansible_user
ansible_ssh_pass
```

### Using variables inside other variables:
```
-
    name: Add DNS server to resolv.conf
    hosts: localhost
    vars:
        dns_server: 10.1.250.10
        dns_server:
            - server1.example.com
            - server2.example.com
            - server3.example.com
        dns_server:
            server1: "server1.example.com"
            server2: "server2.example.com"
            server3: "server3.example.com"
         
     tasks:
        - name: Add DNS server IP to resolv.conf (using variable dns_server_ip)
        - lineinfile:
            path: /etc/resolv.conf
            line: 'nameserver {{ dns_server }}' # {{ }} is a jinja2 templating
            line: nameserver {{ dns_server[0] }} # using list variable
            line: nameserver {{dns_server.server1}} # using dictionary variable

        - name: Add first DNS server from list to resolv.conf
        lineinfile:
            path: /etc/resolv.conf
            line: 'nameserver {{ dsn_server[0] }}'  # Accessing first item from list dsn_server

        - name: Add specific DNS server from dictionary to resolv.conf
        lineinfile:
            path: /etc/resolv.conf
            line: 'nameserver {{ dns_server_names.server1 }}'  # Accessing specific server from dictionary dns_server_names
```

### Variable Precedence

Variables in Ansible follow a specific precedence order, where higher levels take precedence over lower levels. Here's the precedence order from highest to lowest:

1. **--extra-vars**  
   Command-line extra variables (`-e` or `--extra-vars`) take the highest precedence. These variables are passed directly to the playbook command and override all other variable definitions.

2. **Play Vars**  
   Variables defined within a playbook (`vars` section at the play level) come next in precedence. They apply to all tasks within that specific play.

3. **Host Vars**  
   Variables defined for specific hosts in inventory files or directories (like `host_vars`) come next. These variables apply to tasks executed on those specific hosts.

4. **Group Vars**  
   Variables defined for host groups in inventory files or directories (like `group_vars`). These variables apply to all hosts within a specific group.

---
### Register output
```yaml
---
- name: Check /etc/hosts file
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - shell: cat /etc/hosts
    register: result

- debug: 
  var: result.rc # rc means return code
```

---
### Variable Scope
1. Host Scope
2. Play Score
3. Global Variables
#### Host Scope
Variables defined within a specific host context, such as `host_vars` or `group_vars` in inventory files or directories. These variables are accessible within tasks executed on those specific hosts or groups of hosts.
**Example (`host_vars/server1.yml`):**
```yaml
# File: host_vars/server1.yml
ansible_user: admin
ansible_ssh_pass: mypassword
```
#### Play Scope
Variables defined at the play level in an Ansible playbook (vars section within a play). These variables apply to all tasks within that play and are local to that play.
**Example:**
```yaml
---
- name: Example Playbook with Play Scope Variables
  hosts: all
  vars:
    play_var: "This variable is defined at the play level"

  tasks:
    - name: Task using play_var
      debug:
        msg: "{{ play_var }}"

```
#### Global Variables (--extra-vars)
Command-line extra variables (-e or --extra-vars) take the highest precedence. These variables are passed directly to the playbook command and override all other variable definitions.
**Example:**
`ansible-playbook example.yml -e "extra_var=value"`

---
### Magic Variables
1. hostvars
2. group_names
3. inventory_hostname
Ansible provides several built-in magic variables that allow you to access information about hosts, groups, and the execution environment dynamically.
#### 1. hostvars
The `hostvars` magic variable allows access to variables defined for other hosts in your inventory.
**Example Usage:**
```yaml
- name: Example Playbook using hostvars
  hosts: web1
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "DNS Server of web2 is {{ hostvars['web2'].dns_server }}"
    - debug:
        msg: "Architecture of web2 is {{ hostvars['web2'].ansible_facts.architecture }}"
    - debug:
        msg: "Processor of web2 is {{ hostvars['web2']['ansible_facts']['processor'] }}"
```
#### 2. group_names
The group_names magic variable lists all groups to which the current host belongs.
*Example Usage:*
```yaml
- name: Example Playbook using group_names
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "Groups for current host: {{ group_names }}"
```
#### 3. inventory_hostname
The inventory_hostname magic variable provides the name of the current host as defined in the inventory.
*Example Usage:*
```yaml
- name: Example Playbook using inventory_hostname
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "Hostname of current host: {{ inventory_hostname }}"
```

## Ansible Facts
By default, Ansible gathers system facts from remote hosts using the `setup` module before executing tasks. This information is stored in variables and can be used in playbooks or templates. If you want to disable the automatic fact gathering and control when facts are collected, you can adjust the Ansible configuration file (`ansible.cfg`).
### Steps to Disable Automatic Fact Gathering
1. **Locate your `ansible.cfg` file:**
   - The `ansible.cfg` file can typically be found in `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` or in the current directory where you run Ansible (`./ansible.cfg`).

2. **Edit the `ansible.cfg` file:**
   - Add or modify the `gathering` setting under the `[defaults]` section to explicitly disable automatic fact gathering.

     ```ini
     [defaults]
     gathering = explicit
     ```

     Setting `gathering = explicit` means facts will not be gathered automatically. You will need to explicitly specify `gather_facts: yes` in your playbooks when you want to collect facts.

3. **Explicitly gather facts in playbooks:**
   - In your playbooks, where you need to gather facts, add `gather_facts: yes` at the play level.

     ```yaml
     ---
     - hosts: your_hosts
       gather_facts: yes
       tasks:
         - name: Your task here
           # Your tasks go here
     ```

---
## Ansible Playbooks
Ansible playbooks are written in YAML format. Each playbook is a single YAML file containing tasks, which are individual actions to be performed.

### Task Examples
1. Execute a command
2. Run a script
3. Install a package
4. Shutdown/restart a service

### Sample Playbooks
- `play1.yml` and `play2.yml`

### Properties
- **name**: Name of the playbook
- **hosts**: Set at the play level (localhost, anyhost, or group defined in the inventory file)
- **tasks**: List of tasks to be executed

### Modules
Different actions run by tasks are called modules:
- `command`: Execute a command
- `script`: Run a script
- `yum`: Install packages (for Red Hat based systems)
- `apt`: Install packages (for Debian based systems)
- `service`: Manage services (start, stop, restart, etc.)

### Verifying Playbooks
Verification is crucial in production environments to avoid unnoticed errors that could lead to significant downtime or data loss. Methods include:
1. **Check Mode**: `--check` option (simulates changes without applying them)
2. **Diff Mode**: `--check --diff` (shows differences between current and desired states)
3. **Syntax Check**: `ansible-playbook --syntax-check playbook.yml`

### Start At
**Start at task**: `ansible-playbook playbook.yaml --start-at-task "Start httpd service"

### Tags:
`ansible-playbook playbook.yaml --tags "install"`

### Skips Tags
`ansible-playbook playbook.yaml --skip-tags "install"`

### Ansible-Lint
Ansible-Lint is a command-line tool that performs linting on Ansible playbooks, roles, and collections. It checks for errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs to refine playbooks.

### Ansible Conditionals
Conditional statements are useful for managing different OS flavors and ensuring playbooks work across all hosts:
```yaml
when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
```

### Conditionals in Loops
```yaml
when: item.required == True
loop:
  - "{{ packages }}"
```

### Conditionals with Register
```yaml
register: result
when: result.stdout.find('down') != -1
```

### Ansible Loops
Loops allow tasks to be repeated for multiple items:
```yaml
- user: name="{{ item }}" state=present
  loop:
    - joe
    - george
    - mani
```
#### Using with_items:
```yaml
- user: name="{{ item }}" state=present
  with_items:
    - joe
    - george
    - papan
    - mani
```
### Lookup Plugins
Useful plugins for looping:
```yaml
with_file
with_url
with_items
with_dict
with_etcd
many more ...
```

## Ansible Modules

Ansible modules are categorized into various types based on their functionalities:

- **System modules**: Manage system-related tasks.
- **Command modules**: Execute commands on remote hosts (`free_form` allows arbitrary commands).
- **File modules**: Handle file operations like copying, deleting, etc.
- **Database modules**: Manage database tasks.
- **Cloud modules**: Interact with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, etc.).
- **Windows modules**: Perform tasks on Windows hosts.
- **Service modules**: Manage services (ensure they are `started` or `stopped`).

### Idempotency

Ansible modules are designed to be idempotent, meaning their operations can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.

- Example: The `lineinfile` module ensures that a particular line is present or absent in a file, making it idempotent.

## Ansible Plugins

Ansible also supports various plugins that extend its functionality:

- **Dynamic plugins**: Loaded dynamically during playbook execution.
- **Module plugins**: Extend module capabilities.
- **Action plugins**: Custom actions within playbooks.
- **Lookup plugins**: Retrieve data from external sources.
- **Filter plugins**: Modify data within Ansible templates.
- **Connection plugins**: Define how Ansible connects to managed nodes.
- **Inventory plugins**: Generate inventory from external sources.
- **Callback plugins**: Customize output and behavior during playbook runs.

### Module and Plugin Index

To explore available modules and plugins, and for detailed documentation:

- Use `ansible-doc` command:
  ```bash
  ansible-doc <module_name>
  ```
List Ansible hosts (from a custom script, e.g., host_custom.py):
`ansible-inventory --list -i aws_inventory.py
`

---
## Ansible Handlers

Handlers in Ansible are special tasks that are only executed when notified by other tasks. They are typically used to restart services or perform other actions when configuration files are modified. This helps in reducing human errors and ensures that specific tasks are performed only when necessary.

Example playbook snippet using handlers:

```yaml
- name: Update web server configuration
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Copy web server configuration file
      copy:
        src: /path/to/webserver.conf
        dest: /etc/webserver/webserver.conf
      notify: Restart web server

  handlers:
    - name: Restart web server
      service:
        name: webserver
        state: restarted
```
---
## Ansible Roles
Roles in Ansible provide a way to organize and share code, making it easier to reuse and manage complex tasks across different playbooks. Roles are often shared with the community via Ansible Galaxy.
### Creating a Role
To create a new role (e.g., MySQL), use the ansible-galaxy command:
`ansible-galaxy init mysql` # This creates the directory structure for the role.
### Using a Role in a Playbook
Roles can be included in playbooks by specifying them under the roles section:
```yaml
- name: Install and Configure MySQL
  hosts: db-server
  roles:
    - khaleel.mysql
```
Alternatively, with additional options:
```yaml
- name: Install and Configure MySQL
  hosts: db-server
  roles:
    - role: khaleel.mysql
      become: yes
      vars:
        mysql_user_name: db-user-name
```
### Managing Roles
Roles can be stored in a common directory (configured in ansible.cfg) or downloaded directly from Ansible Galaxy:
`ansible-galaxy install khaleel.mysql`
### Listing installed roles:
`ansible-galaxy list`
### Check role configuration:
`ansible-config dump | grep ROLE`
### Sharing Roles
Roles can be shared on Ansible Galaxy by uploading them to GitHub and then referencing them using their Galaxy name.

## Ansible Collections
Ansible Collections are a way to package and distribute Ansible content such as roles, modules, and plugins as self-contained units.

### Installing Collections
Collections are installed using ansible-galaxy:
`ansible-galaxy collection install network.cisco`
### Benefits of Collections
- Expanded functionality: Collections provide specialized functions (e.g., network automation for Cisco, Juniper, etc.).
- Modularity and reusability: Encapsulate functionality into reusable units.
- Simplified distribution and management: Manage versions and dependencies using requirements.yaml.
### Using Installed Collections
Once installed, collections are referenced in playbooks:
```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  collections: [amazon.aws]
  tasks:
    - name: Launch an EC2 instance
      ec2_instance:
        name: my-instance
        region: us-west-1
```

# Ansible Templates with Jinja2

## Jinja2 Templates - String Manipulation and Filters

### Basic Filters:
- `{{ my_name | upper }}` => Converts `my_name` to uppercase.
- `{{ my_name | replace("Bond", "Bounce") }}` => Replaces "Bond" with "Bounce".
- `{{ [1,2,3,4] | min }}` => Finds the minimum value in the list.
- `{{ [1,2,3,4] | max }}` => Finds the maximum value in the list.
- `{{ [1,2,3,2] | unique }}` => Removes duplicates from the list.

### Loops:
```jinja2
{% for number in [0,1,2,3,4] %}
{{ number }}
{% endfor %}
```
### Conditions:
```jinja2
{% for number in [0,1,2,3,4] %}
{% if number == 2 %}
{{ number }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```
### Jinja2 Templates for Dynamic Configs
#### Additional Filters and Functions:
- abs(), float(), lower(), round(), tojson(), etc.
- Custom filters/extensions like b64decode(), basename(), mandatory(), etc.
#### Example: Using basename() Filter:
`{{ "/etc/hosts" | basename }}`
Output: hosts

### How Jinja2 Templating Engine Works:
#### Example template:
```yaml
/etc/ansible/hosts
web1 ansible_host=172.20.2.102 dns_server=10.5.5.4
web2 ansible_host=172.20.2.102 dns_server=10.5.5.4

original:
---
- name: Update dns server
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - nsupdate:
        server: "{{ dns_server }}"
```
#### Ansible converts it to (actual execution):
```yaml
---
- name: Update dns server
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - nsupdate:
        server: 10.5.5.4
```
### Nginx Configuration Example
#### nginx.conf.j2:
```
worker_processes  1;
error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log;

events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}

http {
    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    server {
        listen       {{ nginx_port | default('80') }};  # Default port 80 if nginx_port not defined
        server_name  localhost;

        location / {
            root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }
    }
}
```
### Redis Configuration Example
#### redis.conf.j2:
```
port {{ redis_port | default('6379') }}  # Default port 6379 if redis_port not defined
bind 127.0.0.1;
tcp-backlog 511;
timeout 0;
tcp-keepalive 300;
```
### /etc/resolv.conf Example
#### /etc/resolv.conf.j2:
```
{% for name_server in name_servers %}
nameserver {{ name_server }}
{% endfor %}
```
#### Example usage
```
name_servers:
  - 10.1.1.2
  - 10.1.1.3
  - 8.8.8.8
```
#### Output in /etc/resolv.conf:
```
nameserver 10.1.1.2
nameserver 10.1.1.3
nameserver 8.8.8.8
```

### Template in Roles Example
#### name.txt.j2:
`{{ dialogue | replace('Bourne', 'Bond') }}`
#### playbook.yaml:
```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  vars:
    dialogue: "The name is Bourne, James Bourne!"
  tasks:
    - name: Generate name file
      template:
        src: name.txt.j2
        dest: /tmp/name-file.txt
```
